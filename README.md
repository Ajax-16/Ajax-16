## [NueDB](https://github.com/Ajax-16/nuedb-core)

![](./nuedb_banner.jpg)

NueDB is a relational database system designed to provide a flexible service through SQL-style commands and an HTTP interface for direct interaction with the database. Its capabilities extend to consuming resources from any JSON-formatted REST API endpoint, transforming the data into a series of dynamic table insertions. Additionally, NueDB integrates a query language with a control structure system, enabling users to repeat or condition actions as needed.
